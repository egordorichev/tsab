# todo

* physics: {
 * creating basic bodies (circle, rect)
 * creating bodies from custom fixtures
 * joints
 * contact detection
 * raycasting
}

* fps still performs weirdly (sudden jumps, after a while percision of shader coloring drops?)
* fix config (it relies on maps but the shortcut is objects now?)
* html5: embed config and main.lbc or smth

* input callbacks?: keyPressed, keyReleased, buttonPressed, buttonReleased, mouseMoved, controllerConnected, controllerDisconnected
* imgui
* engine error reporting (audio failed, etc)

* allow to build with a built-in game?
