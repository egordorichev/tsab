# todo

* fps still performs weirdly (sudden jumps, after a while percision of shader coloring drops?)
* fix config (it relies on maps but the shortcut is objects now?)
* html5: embed config and main.lbc or smth

* input callbacks?: keyPressed, keyReleased, buttonPressed, buttonReleased, mouseMoved, controllerConnected, controllerDisconnected
* box2d
